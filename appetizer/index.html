          <h4>Appetizer</h4>
          <h2>Hoisin Glazed Chicken Salad</h2>
          <h4>Serves 4-6</h4>
          <p>
            This is a versatile dish that can be plated as an appetizer or
            entree. It’s a time-saver if you’re having a dinner party because
            all of the components can be made ahead of time for quick assembly
            the day-of. Set the salad in the middle of the table so that guests
            can help themselves or plate individually if you’re serving it as
            the entree.

          <h3>Chicken - Preparation</h3>
          <p>
            It is easier to to shred the chicken thighs when the meat is still
            warm but it can be done chilled as well. Use your fingers to release
            the meat from the bones and shred into pieces about ¼ inch wide
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Add the shredded chicken to a medium size bowl. Mix the cornstarch
            and rice flour together and sift one tablespoon over the chicken.
            Toss together with your fingers and add more sifted cornstarch/rice
            flour if there are uncoated pieces.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Heat a large wok with one inch of vegetable oil on medium high heat
            until the oil temperature reaches 350°F. Test with a candy
            thermometer or one piece of chicken. If the oil begins to froth and
            sizzle rapidly it is hot enough. If the chicken floats to the bottom
            of the pan and there is little movement from the oil, it is not hot
            enough.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Pour small batches of the dredged chicken onto a spider and shake
            off the excess flour. Slowly drop the pieces into the wok and
            shallow fry for 2 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently until crisped
            and golden brown but not dried out. If the oil stops sizzling it
            needs to be hotter so you will need to turn the heat on the stove up
            a notch. If the oil is smoking you can turn the flame off the stove
            for a second, add a small amount of oil at a time to cool down the
            hot oil, and turn the flame back to medium-high heat. When you add
            ingredients to hot oil it immediately lowers the temperature and the
            more ingredients you add at a time, the faster the oil temperature
            drops so it’s best to fry in small batches. Drain on a sheet tray or
            plate lined with paper towels and season with salt.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Apply the same frying technique to the julienned chicken skin,
            without dredging in flour. The chicken skin will only need to fry
            for about 2 minutes to turn golden brown and crispy.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Mix the hoisin sauce with rice wine vinegar and lightly toss the
            crispy chicken in the sauce. Add lemon zest and chives. Season to
            taste if needed.

          <h3>Picked Daikon- Preparation</h3>
          <p>
            Heat the water, sugar, and vinegar in a medium saucepot over medium
            heat until the liquid comes to a boil and the sugar dissolves. Use a
            mandolin or knife to julienne the vegetables. Put the daikon and
            ginger into their own bowls. Pour the hot pickling liquid over each
            vegetable and let soak for 20 minutes before refrigerating. Chill
            before serving.

          <h3>Garnish - Preparation</h3>
          <p>
            Pull off any bruised leaves off the lettuce head. Set the lettuce
            core face down on a cutting board with the leaves facing up.
            Starting with the outer layer, wedge your hands between the leaves
            and the rest of the head. Pry open the leaves and flatten down with
            the palms of your hands. Repeat this step with all of the layers of
            the leaves until you are left with the last layer of the heart
            closed and the leaves open and flattened to resemble a blooming
            flower. Plate lettuce flower on a serving platter and drizzle each
            leaf with vinaigrette
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Spoon the fried chicken mixture evenly in between the lettuce layers
            starting from the bottom. Garnish evenly with pickled daikon and
            ginger. Add the scallions and finish with a few drizzles of the
            vinaigrette.
