          <h2>Raspberry Souffle</h2>
          <h4>Serves 4</h4>
          <p>
            Gordon first learned how to master soufflé while cooking in Paris,
            and he still loves the excitement of putting them into the oven. At
            Gordon’s flagship restaurant in Chelsea, every time he gets an order
            for a souffle he makes three—one for the guest, one to taste test,
            and one just in case something goes wrong with the first soufflé.

          <h3>Raspberry Purée (Coulis) - Preparation</h3>
          <p>
            Add all of the ingredients into a medium saucepot over medium-low
            heat, cover with a lid and steam the berries for 5 to 8 minutes to
            allow them to break down. Remove the lid and continue to cook the
            berries to evaporate the excess water that was released during
            steaming. Let the mixture reduce for about 5 minutes or until the
            liquid turns into a syrupy consistency. Do not let the liquid brown.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Pour the cooked berry mixture into a blender and blend on low speed,
            gradually turning up to high speed for one minute. The result should
            be an evenly-blended almost jam-like consistency.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Take a medium size sieve and place over a bowl. Pour the raspberry
            purée into the sieve and pass through with a rubber spatula. Reserve
            100 grams of the purée and chill for the soufflé base. Keep the
            remaining purée warm or room temperature for the soufflé garnish.

          <h3>Pastry Cream - Preparation</h3>
          <p>
            Gently heat milk over medium heat 3 to 5 minutes until it just
            begins to simmer or scalds. In a medium sized bowl, whisk together
            the egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and vanilla until very well
            incorporated. Slowly whisk small amounts of the scalded milk into
            the egg yolk mixture to temper. Tempering means to slowly mix a hot
            ingredient into a cold or room-temp ingredient (like the egg yolks)
            to slowly raise the temperature of the cold or room-temp ingredient
            while preventing it from overcooking (scrambling in the case of the
            egg yolks). Once half of the milk is incorporated into the bowl,
            pour the mixture back into the saucepot and whisk over medium heat
            until it becomes thick and creamy. Do not let the pastry cream get
            any color while cooking. Pour the pastry cream into a
            plastic-wrap-lined baking pan or wide bowl, lay another sheet of
            plastic over directly touching the pastry cream, and refrigerate for
            a minimum of 30 minutes. Covering the pastry cream will keep it from
            developing a thick skin on top. Allow the pastry cream to cool
            completely before use.

          <h3>Soufflés - Preparation</h3>
          <p>
            Brush a thin layer of butter onto the inside bottom of the ramekins
            and vertically along the sides. Chill the ramekins for a minimum of
            30 seconds to let the butter set. Brush on another thin layer of
            butter, add shaved chocolate into the ramekins, and roll them in
            your hands so the chocolate shavings can tumble around the inside of
            the ramekins to coat the sides evenly. Pour any excess shaved
            chocolate into the next ramekin and repeat until all four are
            coated. Place ramekins in the refrigerator to cool while making the
            soufflé batter.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Preheat the oven to 355°F. In a medium sized bowl, whisk together
            the pastry cream and raspberry purée until very well incorporated.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, begin whisking the
            egg whites at medium speed. Once they begin to foam, squeeze a small
            amount of lemon juice as the whites are still whisking. When the
            volume of the egg whites has increased by ⅔, gradually begin to
            stream the sugar. Tap the bowl of sugar with your finger to control
            the amount of the sugar that is poured in. Increase the speed to
            medium-high and continue whisking the meringue until it forms stiff
            peaks and is bright white and glossy. To make sure the top center of
            the meringue is whipped to the right consistency, turn the speed of
            the machine back to medium, unlock the safety lock, carefully lift
            the arm of the mixer up 1 to 2 inches, and hold it in this place for
            30 seconds. Lower the arm back down and whip for another 10 seconds.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Fold in a third of the meringue into the medium bowl with the pastry
            cream and raspberry purée mixture, until fully smooth and
            incorporated. Gently fold the remaining meringue into the mixture in
            two parts. The volume will decrease slightly but be careful not to
            let too much air out of the meringue.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Fill the ramekins to the top, tap lightly on a flat countertop to
            even out the batter. Using an offset spatula, scrape the tops of the
            soufflés flat. Clean off any excess batter off the outside of the
            ramekins. Finally, place your thumb on the inside edge of the
            ramekin, push about ⅙ inch down into the edge of the souffle batter,
            and rotate the ramekin in your other hand as you drag your thumb to
            wipe a small amount of batter from the edge. This is another trick
            to ensure your soufflé will rise straight up.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Place no more than two ramekins on a sheet tray at a time and bake
            in the center rack. If using 10-ounce ramekins, bake for 14 to 17
            minutes, or until the tops of the soufflés are golden brown. If
            using 6-ounce ramekins, bake for 10-12 minutes.

            Dust with powdered sugar, place a fresh raspberry in the center and
            serve. For a more formal presentation, dust with powdered sugar,
            poke two holes into the center soufflé with a small spoon, and pour
            in fresh raspberry coulis in just before serving.
