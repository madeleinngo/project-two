          <h2>Fried Branzino with Thai Chili Lettuce Cups</h2>
          <h4>Serves 4-6</h4>
          <p>
            When Gordon spent six months in southeast Asia, he spent time living
            with a family on the Mekong River Delta in southern Vietnam. This
            dish is a refined version of the whole fried snapper the family
            would often make for dinner. It’s is visually stunning and
            interactive. Your guests will come together over the whole fish and
            build their own lettuce cups. Since this will be presented in the
            middle of the table, it’s important to trim the sharp, spiky fins.

          <h3>Branzino - Preparation</h3>
          <p>
            Heat 1½ inches of vegetable oil 350-360°F. Place a sheet tray with a
            wire rack or lined with paper towels next to your frying station so
            you can easily remove the fish from the wok after frying.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut the fins and tail off of the
            fish. The fish scraps can be saved in an airtight container in the
            refrigerator for up to three days and made into make a fish stock.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Use a chef’s knife or fillet knife to cut ⅓ inch deep down both
            sides of the vertebrae. Starting one side of the fish one inch away
            from and parallel to the gills, make 4 to 5 diagonal slices into the
            flesh , cutting all the way to the ribs and spacing the slices 2
            inches apart. Repeat with the other side.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In a large bowl, combine the garlic, ginger, shallots, lemongrass,
            Thai chilis, Shaoxing wine, fish sauce, honey, and rice wine
            vinegar. Let marinate for a minimum of one hour before use.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Place the branzino in a large baking dish. Use a pastry brush to
            liberally brush the Shaoxing marinade inside the cavity, into the
            cuts, , and onto the skin. Season each area with a few pinches of
            salt and a few twists of fresh cracked pepper. Drain the excess
            marinade and place fish onto a new baking tray.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Combine the cornstarch and rice flour. Sift over both sides of the
            fish with a small hand strainer. Make sure all the fish is covered
            with flour, including the cuts to ensure a crispy crust. The drier
            the fish is the more even fry it will produce. Shake off any excess
            flour, then stand the fish up on its belly pulling the belly flaps
            outward.. If the fish falls over, make a longer cut from the belly
            to create a wider base and help the fish stand up easily in the wok.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Set the center of the fish (where it holds the most weight) onto a
            spider and carefully place into the hot oil. The oil should froth
            and sizzle. The temperature of the oil will drop once the fish in in
            so increase the heat to medium high to bring it back up to a sizzle.
            Shallow fry the fish until deep golden brown and very crispy, 8 to
            10 minutes. As it cooks, ladle hot oil over any exposed part of the
            fish to ensure even cooking. You will see the cuts you made open up
            away from the spine and turn golden brown. Once the flesh no longer
            looks opaque it is done cooking. Remember that the cooking process
            will continue even after the fish is out of the oil because of the
            heat trapped in the flesh.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Carefully remove the fish from the oil, Use one hand to grab the
            tail (if it is too hot use tongs or a towel), lift the tail end of
            the fish slightly, and slide the spider under the belly. Lift the
            fish and carefully set on the wire rack over a sheet pan to drain.
            Season immediately with salt. Turn off the heat, let the oil cool
            down, and reserve in a mason jar or dispose.

          <h3>Dipping Sauce - Preparation</h3>
          <p>
            In a medium mixing bowl, stir together all the ingredients. Chill in
            the refrigerator and chill until ready to plate

          <h3>Assorted Pickles - Preparation</h3>
          <p>
            Heat the water, sugar, and vinegar in a medium sized saucepot over
            medium heat until the liquid comes to a boil and the sugar
            dissolves. Add each julienned vegetable to separate bowls or mason
            jars. Pour the hot pickling liquid over the ginger and carrots and
            let soak for 20 minutes before refrigerating. Let the pickling
            liquid cool before pouring over the cucumbers and mango. Chill for 1
            hour or longer before serving. Once ready to use drain the pickles
            and mix all of the pickles together evenly..
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="body-paragraph">
          <h3>Lettuce Cups - Preparation</h3>
          <p>
            To make the lettuce cups, select a big, dense head of iceberg
            lettuce that looks fresh and free of pinkish discoloration. Peel and
            discard wilted outer leaves and use a paring knife to cut out the
            core.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Place the head of lettuce core side up in an ice bath, allowing the
            water to fill in between the leaves to separate them slightly. Lift
            the lettuce up out of the water and tilt upside down to drain the
            water. Carefully separate the leaves until the leaves become too
            small or too curly for making cups and set aside in a colander to
            drain. Save the rest of the lettuce to chiffonade or plating.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To trim into a lettuce cup place a leaf in the palm of your hand,
            use a pair of clean kitchen scissors to trim off the stiff white
            stem and the edges of the leaf into a 3 to 4 inch circle. Repeat
            with the remaining leaves. Reserve the nice lettuce cups in stacks
            of 4 to 6 on a tray or plate lined with paper towels.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="body-paragraph">
          <h3>Plate + Garnish - Preparation</h3>
          <p>
            Marinate the fried branzino with two spoonfuls of the Thai dipping
            sauce in the crevasses and let it rest for 2 minutes. Place the
            fried branzino on the center of a long rectangle platter or slate
            board. Place one to two tablespoons of chiffonade iceberg lettuce
            into each lettuce cup, followed by one tablespoon of the mixed
            pickles. Top the pickles with a pinch or two of the sliced
            scallions. Spoon about one teaspoon of the Thai dipping sauce into
            each lettuce cup. Place filled lettuce cups around the fish, three
            above and three below. Pour the remaining Thai dipping sauce into a
            small serving bowl with a spoon. When ready to serve, use a utility
            knife or two forks or tongs to pull of a portion of fried fish into
            a lettuce cup and pour one spoon of Thai dipping sauce over the
            fish. Add more filled lettuce cups to the platter as needed.
